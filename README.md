# Description: 
A repository containing a dataset of abalone physical measurements, sex, and age, along with data visualizations using Vega-Lite to explore patterns and trends.

# Abstract:
This repository focuses on the analysis of abalone physical measurements and age. The dataset consists of 4177 rows and 9 columns, containing data on abalone sex, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and rings (which represent age). The objective is to gain insights into the relationships between the physical measurements and the age of abalones, potentially identifying patterns or trends.

Two primary tasks are performed on the dataset using Vega-Lite for visualization:

Compare the distributions of physical measurements (length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, and shell weight) between male and female abalones. This is done by creating separate histograms for each physical measurement column based on sex.
Investigate the relationship between the age of abalones (represented by rings) and their physical measurements. This is accomplished by creating scatterplots for each physical measurement column with the Rings column on the y-axis.
These visualizations can help provide a better understanding of the dataset and lead to further analysis in the field of marine biology, specifically in the study of abalone growth patterns and factors affecting their physical development.
